Specifically, the bill provides funding for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to (1) assist agricultural producers with the costs of crop nutrient use or adopting precision agriculture practices, and (2) provide grants to eligible entities (e.g., fueling and distribution facilities) for biofuel infrastructure. The bill establishes within USDA the Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters, which must investigate and prosecute violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by packers and live poultry dealers. Additionally, USDA must (1) establish an agriculture and food supply chain task force, and (2) provide assistance to address fertilizer shortages and reduce dependency on foreign sources for fertilizer. The bill allows USDA to make loans and grants for livestock and poultry processing. Further, the bill incorporates support for precision agriculture into various USDA programs. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service must enter into certain cooperative agreements for establishing supply chain regional resource centers to support small- and medium-sized producers of agricultural products and agricultural businesses. The bill also applies the Reid vapor pressure (a measure of gasoline's volatility) requirements that are applicable to gasoline blended with 10% ethanol (E10) to gasoline blended with more than 10% ethanol. Thus, the waiver given to E10 gasoline, which allows an increase in the Reid Vapor Pressure volatility, is extended to gasoline blended with more than 10% ethanol. \",\n",

The bill also automatically grants emergency use authorization for rapid tests approved by certain foreign regulators. Specifically, HHS must purchase a sufficient quantity of rapid tests to provide two tests per week at no cost to each resident for the 12 months following the bill's enactment. The President may use authorities available under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to obtain the tests. That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense. In addition, HHS must conduct outreach about the availability of free rapid tests to Medicare and Medicaid participants and make the tests available through those programs. The bill also automatically grants emergency use authorization during the public health emergency for rapid tests that are listed for emergency use by (1) the World Health Organization (WHO), or (2) a foreign regulator that is a stringent regulatory authority as defined by the WHO for purposes of medicine procurement. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may rescind authority for, or otherwise regulate, a rapid test that was automatically authorized. Additionally, the FDA must establish a permanent advisory committee focused on diagnostic and serological testing for public health needs.\",\n",

Next, the bill establishes Election Day as a federal holiday. The bill establishes certain federal criminal offenses related to voting. In particular, the bill establishes a new criminal offense for conduct (or attempted conduct) to corruptly hinder, interfere with, or prevent another person from registering to vote or helping someone register to vote. Additionally, the bill sets forth provisions related to election security, including by requiring states to conduct post-election audits for federal elections. The bill outlines criteria for congressional redistricting and generally prohibits mid-decade redistricting. The bill addresses campaign finance, including by expanding the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals and establishing an alternative campaign funding system for certain federal offices. Next, the bill establishes new criteria for determining which states and political subdivisions must obtain preclearance before changes to voting practices may take effect. Preclearance is the process of receiving preapproval from the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia before making legal changes that would affect voting rights.

The bill also prohibits USDA from imposing restrictions on the quantity of energy that is generated under a grant or loan. Further, the bill expands the program by making agricultural producer cooperatives, electric cooperatives, and nongovernmental organizations eligible for financial assistance under the program. The bill also (1) increases from 25% to 50% the portion of a project's cost that may be covered by a grant, and (2) establishes a reserve fund to provide grants and other financial assistance related to underutilized renewable energy technologies.

This bill allows a compounder not registered with the FDA to compound drugs in limited quantities for urgent medical need not involving a specific patient if, among other things, (1) the prescriber certifies that they are unable to obtain, despite reasonable attempts, certain related drugs with the same active ingredient and route of administration; (2) the compounded drug meets certain labeling requirements, including an indication that the compounded drug is provided only for urgent administration to a patient; and (3) the compounder requests and maintains certain records about patients receiving the compounded drug. Furthermore, a restriction against an unregistered compounder regularly compounding (or compounding inordinate amounts of) what is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug shall not apply if the drug is on a shortage list maintained by the FDA or the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists.

The term does not include a time out, which may involve separating the student from others in a non-locked setting. The bill prohibits the use of mechanical or chemical restraints or physical restraints that restrict breathing or are life threatening. The bill outlines the requirements for the use of physical restraint, including that the student's behavior must pose an imminent danger of serious physical injury to the student or other individual. Each state must ensure that a sufficient number of program personnel are trained and certified by a state-approved crisis intervention training program. Additionally, each program must establish procedures to follow after an incident involving physical restraint. Further, the bill establishes enforcement provisions, including a private right of action for a student who has been subjected to unlawful seclusion or restraint. The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services must withhold payments from a program for unlawful seclusion or restraint. Finally, the bill requires each state educational agency (SEA) to establish, implement, and enforce policies and procedures required by the bill. It also creates a grant program to assist SEAs with these activities.\",\n",

Specifically, the bill applies the liability protection to claims arising from third-party speech rather than third-party information. Additionally, the liability protection shall not apply if a user or provider (1) accepts payment to make the speech available, or (2) creates or funds (in whole or in part) the speech.  The bill changes legal procedures concerning the liability protection by (1) requiring a defendant in a lawsuit to raise the liability protection as an affirmative defense, and (2) placing the burden of proving that the defense applies on the defendant. Some courts have held that the current liability protection bars claims for civil penalties and injunctive relief. The bill expressly excludes from the liability protection requests for injunctive relief arising from a provider's failure to remove, restrict access to, or prevent dissemination of material likely to cause irreparable harm. However, the bill protects a provider from liability for actions taken to comply with such injunctions. Under current law, the liability protection does not apply to federal criminal law, intellectual property law, and other designated areas of law. The bill further specifies that the liability protection shall not apply to civil rights law; antitrust law; stalking, harassment, or intimidation laws; international human rights law; and civil actions for wrongful death.\",\n",

The bill also provides funds and establishes grants for states to create preschool programs for low- to moderate-income children between the ages of three and five years. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must make grants to Head Start agencies to provide children with access to full-school-year and full-school-day services, provide access to additional service hours for migrant and seasonal agencies, or enhance the quality of existing services.

Specifically, the bill establishes a presumption of service-connection for certain illnesses becoming manifest in covered veterans to a degree of 10% or more. Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.

Among other elements, the bill   requires the VA to provide medical examinations for veterans who submit a claim for disability compensation for an illness not listed in the bill but that is asserted to be related to airborne hazard or open burn pit exposure; authorizes the VA to stay pending claims for disability compensation related to the service and illnesses covered by this bill until the implementation of the bill; and provides VA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to covered veterans. \",\n",

The bill (1) permits the complaining party to rely on any type or form of admissible evidence, which need only be sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find that an unlawful practice occurred; and (2) declares that the complaining party shall not be required to demonstrate that age or retaliation was the sole cause of the employment practice (thereby rejecting the Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., which requires the complainant to prove that age was the but-for cause for the employer's decision). The bill applies this evidentiary standard to other employment discrimination and retaliation claims, including claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In a claim in which age discrimination is shown, but where the employer demonstrates that it would have taken the same action absent the motivating factor of age, the bill authorizes courts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, but prohibits the court from awarding damages or issuing an order requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment. This limitation also applies to claims of discrimination based on disability. The bill also includes reporting requirements for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor.\",\n",

       "  'summary': \"Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021 This bill expands various labor protections related to employees' rights to organize and collectively bargain in the workplace. Among other things, it (1) revises the definitions of employee, supervisor, and employer to broaden the scope of individuals covered by the fair labor standards; (2) permits labor organizations to encourage participation of union members in strikes initiated by employees represented by a different labor organization (i.e., secondary strikes); and (3) prohibits employers from bringing claims against unions that conduct such secondary strikes. The bill also allows collective bargaining agreements to require all employees represented by the bargaining unit to contribute fees to the labor organization for the cost of such representation, notwithstanding a state law to the contrary; and expands unfair labor practices to include prohibitions against replacement of, or discrimination against, workers who participate in strikes. The bill makes it an unfair labor practice to require or coerce employees to attend employer meetings designed to discourage union membership and prohibits employers from entering into agreements with employees under which employees waive the right to pursue or a join collective or class-action litigation. The bill further prohibits employers from taking adverse actions against an employee, including employees with management responsibilities, in response to that employee participating in protected activities related to the enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair labor practices (i.e., whistleblower protections). Such protected activities include  providing information about a potential violation to an enforcement agency, participating in an enforcement proceeding, initiating a proceeding concerning an alleged violation or assisting in such a proceeding, or refusing to participate in an activity the employee reasonably believes is a violation of labor laws.  Finally, the bill addresses the procedures for union representation elections, provides employees with the ability to vote in such elections remotely by telephone or the internet, modifies the protections against unfair labor practices that result in serious economic harm, and establishes penalties and permits injunctive relief against entities that fail to comply with National Labor Relations Board orders.  \",\n",

The bill restores school infrastructure tax credit bonds. The bill also sets forth reporting requirements, including annual reports on grant program projects and a report by the Government Accountability Office that requires a study of the geographic distribution of projects, the impact of projects on student and staff health and safety, and the accessibility of projects to high-poverty schools. Next, the bill extends through FY2026 the Impact Aid Construction program.

First, the bill expands the authority of, and provides funding for, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to provide special partition assistance to a multiemployer pension plan that is insolvent or at risk of insolvency. The bill expands eligibility for partition assistance, provides funding for a plan to reach a projected funded ratio of 80% over a 30-year period, and does not require a plan to repay such assistance. The bill further permits a multiemployer pension plan to elect to retain its funding zone status from the previous year for either (1) the first plan year beginning during the period from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021; or (2) the next succeeding plan year, as designated by the plan sponsor. A plan may also extend by five years the funding improvement or rehabilitation period if the plan is designated as in endangered or critical status for a plan year beginning in 2020 or 2021. A plan in critical and declining status may not suspend payment of plan benefits. Additionally, the bill adjusts the minimum funding standards for a multiemployer pension plan to account for investment losses and other losses related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and modifies the PBGC guarantee formula to increase the maximum potential benefits under a multiemployer pension plan. Finally, the bill makes changes with respect to single employer pension plans, including revising the amortization rules and extending and modifying the pension funding stabilization percentages.',\n",

Further, the bill specifies that the disclaimer requirement applies to an agent whether the agent is within or outside the United States. Upon notification by the Department of Justice (DOJ), an online platform must remove any materials that do not meet disclaimer requirements and must use reasonable efforts to inform recipients of the materials that they were disseminated by an agent on behalf of a foreign principal.

Whereas the Olympic charter states the goal of Olympism is to promote a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity; Whereas, according to the September 2020 House of Representatives China Task Force Report, the Government of China is the leading human rights abuser in the world, depriving 1,400,000,000 human beings of their fundamental rights; Whereas, since 2017, the Government of China has detained and persecuted up to 1,800,000 Turkic Muslims, including ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, in political re-education centers, and many detainees who have not graduated from the facilities have been convicted of formal crimes and sentenced to prison terms; Whereas detained and imprisoned Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are held arbitrarily and without due process, coerced to disavow religious beliefs and cultural practices, forced to work in factories, deprived of food and other essential needs, and subjected to physical abuse, including torture and alleged organ harvesting; Whereas the Government of China is implementing a policy of employing large numbers of Uyghurs, including former detainees, in labor-intensive factories in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China under forced labor conditions;  Whereas the Government of China has implemented policies against minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to lower birth rates, including forced abortions, sterilizations, and contraception; Whereas according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an estimated 8,500 mosques have been demolished in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and nearly 30 percent of Islamic shrines, cemeteries, and other sites of religious importance in the region have been damaged or destroyed, mostly since 2017; Whereas Article 2 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which both the United States and China have ratified, defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [or] (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.; Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State determined that the Government of China, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party, has committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, and on the same day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed, stating, forcing men, women and children into concentration camps, trying to in effect re-educate them to be adherents to the Chinese Communist Party—all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide; Whereas, in June 2020, the legislature of China passed a national security law for Hong Kong restricting basic political rights and authorizing severe punishments for anyone inside or outside Hong Kong found guilty of broad vaguely defined crimes, effectively ending the longstanding one country, two systems policy; Whereas, in September 2020, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Minority Staff Report on the origins of the COVID–19 global pandemic found that— authorities in China harassed, detained, and disappeared individuals who told the truth about the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of the COVID–19 pandemic;  during the early outbreak of the COVID–19 pandemic, the Government of China failed to meet an international legal requirement to inform the World Health Organization of the COVID–19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; during the early stages of the COVID–19 pandemic, the Government of China knew of the deadly human-to-human transmission capabilities of the virus and took steps to hide it from the public and global community; and in February 2020, the Government of China nationalized their medical supply chain to stockpile personal protective equipment and stop foreign exports to other countries battling the COVID–19 pandemic; Whereas, in October 2020, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab stated, regarding a potential boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics due to human rights violations against the Uyghurs, that my instinct is to separate sport from diplomacy and politics, but there comes a point where that may not be possible; Whereas, in September 2020, an international coalition of human rights organizations wrote to the International Olympic Committee requesting the committee reverse its mistake in awarding Beijing the honor of hosting the Winter Olympic Games in 2022; Whereas, in November 2020, the Australian Parliament debated a motion calling on the Australian Government to work with the Australian Olympic Committee to ensure Australia boycotts the 2022 Winter Olympics games in Beijing; Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial board of The Washington Post opposed the Government of China hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics and stated, the world must ask whether China, slowly strangling an entire people, has the moral standing to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. We think not.; Whereas, in 1980, in H. Con.
